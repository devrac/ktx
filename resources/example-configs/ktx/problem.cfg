//
// PASSWORD BASED VIP
// 
// To use it, the admin has to set the following things:
// maxvip_spectators <count>
// vip_password <pass1 pass2 pass3 ... pass6>  - use "none" as pass if you want to disable a specific level!
// 
// The client needs use "password pass" or "spectator pass" if he wants to become a VIP.
// 
// level 1 (   "1" in binary form, ie set first bit ) just vip
// level 2 (  "10" in binary form, ie set second bit ) demo admin
// level 3 (  "11" in binary form, ie set first and second bit ) admin
// level 4 ( "100" in binary form, ie set 3-t bit ) judge (judge including admin)
// level 5 ( "101" in binary form, ie set 3-t and 1-t bit ) admin and demo admin
// level 6 ( "110" in binary form, ie set 3-t and 2-t bit ) judge admin and demo admin
// 

//
// IP BASED VIP
//
//    Changed way of using *VIP value in mod.
//     Every VIP can still connect as spectator with every level (it is made serverside) 
//     but now you can set extra flags (like fpd)
//      1 (      "1" in binary form, ie set first bit ) - normal VIP (default)
//      2 (     "10" in binary form, ie set second bit ) - not kickable VIP by elected admins
//      4 (    "100" in binary form, ie set 3-t bit ) - VIP with admin rights
//      8 (   "1000" in binary form, ie set 4-t bit ) - VIP with demo admin rights
//     16 (  "10000" in binary form, ie set 5-t bit ) - VIP with judge rights
//     32 ( "100000" in binary form, ie set 6-t bit ) - VIP with rcon admin rights
//
//     example: 
//      - vip_addip 1.2.3.4 2  = not kickable VIP
//      - vip_addip 1.2.3.4 6  = not kickable VIP with admin rights
//      - vip_addip 1.2.3.4 63 = VIP with all permissions

THE PROBLEM:

So if u authorized with pass, and for example get
level 6 ( "110" in binary form, ie set 3-t and 2-t bit ) judge admin and demo admin.

Actually, insted of this "judge admin and demo admin" u get rights wich equal to 3-t and 2-t bits for ip based vips,
ie: 4 (    "100" in binary form, ie set 3-t bit ) - VIP with admin rights
	2 (     "10" in binary form, ie set second bit ) - not kickable VIP by elected admins

Thats not we are expected, right?
